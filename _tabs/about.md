## Where does the ninja cat meme üê±‚Äçüë§ come from?

Drawing inspiration from the viral [Welcome to the Internet meme by Jason Heuser](https://sharpwriter.deviantart.com/art/Welcome-to-the-Internet-Please-Follow-me-322248378), [KC Lemson](https://twitter.com/kclemson) created a graphic for a PowerPoint presentation that showed the cat (which Lemson says is a female) on a unicorn holding a flag adorned with the Microsoft logo.

`Being a ninja cat is more than just being a ninja. Or a cat. It's a state of mind.`

It has become the unofficial mascot of Microsoft employees and carries the gist of inspiration in the workplace, nerding-out your passion, being creative and taking yourself not too serious at times while still delivering exceptional results. We humans think "outside our box" and come up with solutions for tough problems best when our minds are running free. [KC Lemson](https://news.microsoft.com/life/ninja-cat/) - the inventor of the ninja cat - also uses the term "surfing on chaos". What could better depict that than the ninja cat riding on a T-Rex?



See also the dev blog "[The origin story of the Microsoft ninjacat](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160804-00/?p=94025)" for another angle into the story.

Microsoft is a home that thrives on solving interesting problems. SAP software powering global commerce and transactions being one of them, this is a perfect match.

[KC Lemson](https://news.microsoft.com/life/ninja-cat/) and her invention of the ninja-cat definitely had a huge impact on Microsoft's culture. We are proud to carry it forward as mascot for the joint Microsoft + SAP journey.

By the way, which meme do you like best? Here are a couple for you to get as inspired as KC got when she invented the mascot. Found some more? Please share them with us. We are always eager to get more triggers for inspiration.
