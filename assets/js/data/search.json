In contrast to conventional stability techniques, its objective is to maximize the availability of systems and system landscapes rather than to decrease the likelihood of failure occurring. It embraces the unavoidability and unpredictability of failures and concentrates on resolving them as soon as feasible."

I’m interested mainly in application and data integration, so whenever new functionality is available, I want to test it and share it with you. Today I cover something BIG! If you have ever extracted data from an SAP system, you know it can quickly become a complex process. Transactional tables often contain millions or even billions of rows, and as the extraction process resource-intensive operation, the daily processing of the entire dataset is usually impossible. SAP Table connector, one of the most frequently used by SAP customers, heavily suffered from these challenges. Therefore I’m super excited that Azure Data Factory has a new family member. The new SAP CDC connector, released a couple of months ago and currently available in Public Preview, uses the SAP Operational Data Provisioning API to extract data. It’s an actual game changer – the new connector is robust, performant and reliable. And what I like the most, it also automatically merges all delta extracts into a consistent target data store."

An interesting overture to address this could be usage of contextual  notifications. Adaptive Cards from Microsoft not only offer the contextual awareness, but allow the user to trigger certain actions in a plethora of user interface components . Since adaptive cards are also an open source technology, it makes it even more interesting.

This blog describes it in detail.  I already explained how one could use Google’s Vertex AI to do this job as an external platform.

I already explained how crucial is extraction optimization. The created Synapse Pipeline can use client-side paging to chunk a large request into several smaller ones. In the last episode, we focused on data filtering to copy only the required information. Both solutions improve the performance and reliability of the extraction, but a full data copy is not always an answer. It is not uncommon to have millions or even billions of records in the largest tables. A daily extraction job to copy everything is pretty much impossible in such scenarios. It would take too much time and cause performance challenges on SAP application servers. Multiple extractions every day could cause even more problems."

With this 3rd part of the blog series, you will build a distributed cloud application with different components running in Azure, BTP and SAP backend on-premise. From an end-user perspective, this application offers a chat bot interface in Microsoft Teams, which allows to search for IT equipment in a product catalogue. The product data such as price, category and an image is retrieved from the SAP backend system, where access control is enforced based on the Azure AD-authenticated user’s authorizations.

      "content"  : "One of the most common documents each company has to deal with are invoices coming from various suppliers. Whenever you buy products or services, you receive a document that lists your partner address data, together with line items, total value, and tax calculation. Each invoice has to be registered in your finance system, which can be a time-consuming task. At the same time, it’s not a challenging activity – you basically copy information from the source document. To automate the process, many companies already exchange invoices in a digital format. But such an approach is not always possible. So, despite living in 2021, and landing on the moon over 50 years ago, a piece of paper is still an important information carrier."

List of orders, production plans, sales forecasts, and what’s even more important the key financial data are hosted on SAP. Therefore, each organization should ensure that this information is kept in a secure way that makes it impossible to read in the case when an unauthorized party gets access to database files or backup media. Microsoft does a great job in protecting customers’ data – all information stored in Azure are by default encrypted at rest, so even if the attackers got access to the physical Azure hardware, they would not be able to make any use of it. For infrastructure workloads, customers can in addition decide to put another level of protection and encrypt virtual disks, which makes it impossible to read stored data without having an encryption key. But the disk encryption at-rest won’t help if the attacker receives access to your virtual machine and is able to make a copy of the database. Or if your database backup leaks. In such a case they can just restore the database on another server and access the data without any issue."

However, such highly distributed systems also come with costs, e.g. for their increased communication overhead and additional operational complexity. Quite often, those services are not deployed in a single system landscape. They are distributed across different regions, geographies (e.g. for availability and performance reasons), or even clouds. In such a multi-cloud setup with multiple platforms from different vendors, interoperability and standards become an important aspect to consider when designing a solution.

We have designed two applications that communicate with an SAP system and today we are going to enhance the solution by establishing a cross-company integration. I will go through all required steps to enable a secure communication channel using the AS2 protocol to send encrypted and signed messages using certificates. On top, we will validate IDocs against a schema and modify them using XML transformation. Azure Data lake will be the storage for our messages archive and Key Vault will protect private keys.

It offers a fully managed Spark clusters that can be created within seconds and automatically terminated when not used. It can even scale up and down depending on the current utilization. As all Azure services, the Databricks natively connects to other cloud platform services like the Data Lake storage or Azure Data Factory.

I have already presented a few interesting scenarios where you can use a kubernets cluster to host multiple HANA databases or protect your landscape against unexpected events with integrated disaster recovery. Azure Logic Apps is another service that you can use to enhance and optimize SAP landscape. It allows you to build chains of actions and integrate SAP solution with external systems."

In case your disaster recovery plan is limited to performing daily backups, then just the process of provisioning new hardware (or VMs) can already take a long time – and you still need to move the data, install the software and finally restore the backup. On the other hand, having a cold standby site with ongoing database replication may be too expensive, especially for smaller organizations. But is it still a true? Does a secondary site have to be expensive?"
