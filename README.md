# Jekyll build project based upon Chirpy theme

- [Jekyll docs](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
- [Theme source](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/#usage)

## Installation

Note: Since our project is already setup, you can skip the steps to setup a fresh site and yml config.

- Follow [installation guidance](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for Jekyll for your OS.
- For chirpy Ruby-build setup *bundle* from [here](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/#installing-dependencies).
- Familiarize yourself with the [Jekyll CLI commands](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).

Typically you will use `jekyll serve` to run locally.

## Adding content

Please check existing categories (note parent-child relationship) and tags to keep the search meaningful. New markdown files are added to the **_posts** folder. The filename needs to start with the date. For simplicity copy an existing one and alter to your needs.

Once you push to GitHub our GitHub Action will automatically build the jekyll site and update the serving branch gh-pages.

## Usage

Please see the [theme's docs](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#documentation).
