The topic of side-by-side extension is out now for quite a while in the SAP ecosystem, but the playfield changed a bit over the last years as some new players entered the field (e. g. a managed Kyma offering) and the combination (or should I say the embrace) of the SAP stack and non-SAP platforms (like Microsoft Azure) has also gained attention. With this post I would like to dig into one possible scenario on how such an extension can look like focusing on the “new” players and see where there are pitfalls or issues be it because of combining SAP and Microsoft or due to problems in one or the other platform itself.
