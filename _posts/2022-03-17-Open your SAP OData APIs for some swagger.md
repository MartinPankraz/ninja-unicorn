Dear community,

Me and Will Eastbury have been busy building upon the work of the Oasis Foundation in the OData + OpenAPI space, where SAP and Microsoft are large contributors. Today is the day of easily converting your OData metadata into the widely spread OpenAPI definition and making that available to external consumers. Hence, opening your platform to a wide eco system of APIs and developer expertise. üåé This becomes more and more relevant due to SAP‚Äôs initiative to ‚Äúkeep the ABAP core clean‚Äù, ‚Äúside-by-side-extension‚Äù pattern and the race for developers.
