Dear community,

Many discussions around moving SAP to Azure, AWS, Alibaba or GCP circle around IaaS capabilities, cost of running production and maintenance procedures for instance. However, in my opinion moving the system containing the most valuable data, that a company owns, close to an environment that thrives on innovation and rapid adoption of new trends is much more interesting. One of those trends is Machine Learning. Therefore, at the heart of today’s blog post is the Text Analytics API provided by Azure Cognitive Services.
