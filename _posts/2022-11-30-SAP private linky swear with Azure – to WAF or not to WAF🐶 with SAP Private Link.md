Dear community,

Continuing with the implementation journey of [SAP Private Link Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/PRIVATE_LINK/42acd88cb4134ba2a7d3e0e62c9fe6cf/af86a457ffd84324a6691c6ea1649dd6.html) (PLS) for Azure we will have a closer look at connecting [privately](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/private-link) to your Azure workloads via the [Azure Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/overview) (App Gateway) using the Microsoft backbone. Why is this interesting?
