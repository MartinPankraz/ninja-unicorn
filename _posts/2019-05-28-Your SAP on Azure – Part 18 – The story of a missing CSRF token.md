I like IT puzzles. Especially when they relate to SAP. When I find an interesting topic, I won’t leave my desk until I find the solution. So when my colleague [Roman Broich](https://people.sap.com/roman_broich_msft) wrote me a short message that he was fighting with OData and SAP, my eyes widened and my breath accelerated. I already knew it would absorb me completely. “It can’t be trivial, otherwise he wouldn’t even mention about it” – I thought. So I just wrote a quick text to my wife that she shouldn’t disturb me when she’s back from work, I prepared a fresh cup of coffee and I was ready to go.
