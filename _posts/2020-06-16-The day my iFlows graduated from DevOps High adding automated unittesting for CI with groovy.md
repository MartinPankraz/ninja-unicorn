Dear community,

Last time we spoke about applying some nice DevOps practices to your iFlow developments on SAP CPI. We covered agile development with Azure Boards integration, linking code changes to user stories or issues, releasing the groovy scripts to SAP CPI and finally deploying the updated iFlow in your tenant automatically. You can find the corresponding blog post here.
