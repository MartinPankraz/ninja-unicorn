Hello and welcome back to your ABAP Cloud with Microsoft integration journey. Part 0 of this series got you covered with the prerequisites to get your SAP dev environment with ABAP Development Tools (ADT) on Eclipse up and running.

#Kudos to Karl Kessler, Harish Bokkasam, Andre Fischer and team for the nudges in the right directions when it comes to ABAP Cloud ðŸ¤Ÿ

Wow, that was a mouthful ðŸ¤¯but no worries, there will be screenshots and more mumbo-jumbo to help you along. See below the architecture for the flow.
