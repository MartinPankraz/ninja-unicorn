  In this blogpost you will learn how to create an SAP BTP development CI/CD pipeline integrated with Azure DevOps – allowing you to run pipelines on Azure DevOps that continuously deploy new features to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment while still being able to benefit from complementing DevOps-related SAP BTP services, such as around transport, alerting and technical ops automation. With this, you get an example of how you can perform agile development on SAP BTP using a third-party CI/CD infrastructure – complementing the option to start simple by using SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, where no separate CI/CD infrastructure would be required.
