Dear community,

Continuing with the implementation journey of BTP Private Link Service (PLS) we will have a closer look at integrating services from the Azure PaaS portfolio, that are not yet added by SAP to the BTP solution.

This post builds upon part 6 of the series in terms of SAP Personal Security Environment (PSE).
