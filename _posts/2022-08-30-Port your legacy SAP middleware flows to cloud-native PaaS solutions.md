Dear community,

Thanks to SAP you can sit on your legacy SAP Process Integration/Orchestration a little while longer if you want ‚Äì mainstream [maintenance](https://community.sap.com/topics/abap/netweaver-maintenance-strategy) till 2027 and [extended maintenance](https://support.sap.com/en/release-upgrade-maintenance/maintenance-information/maintenance-strategy/s4hana-business-suite7.html) till 2030. According to the annual [global community survey 2022](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/06/01/results-of-the-global-survey-for-sap-integration-2022/) many of you intend to do so beyond 2025. But if you are brave enough or looking to drive your own destiny ahead of time ‚Äì competitive edge anyone? ‚Äì you are in for an adventure üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
