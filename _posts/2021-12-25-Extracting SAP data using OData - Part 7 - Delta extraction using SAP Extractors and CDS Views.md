Seven weeks passed in a blink of an eye, and we are at the end of the Summer with OData-based extraction using Synapse Pipeline. Each week I published a new episode that reveals best practices on copying SAP data to the lake, making it available for further processing and analytics. Today’s episode is a special one. Not only it is the last one from the series, but I’m going to show you some cool features around data extraction that pushed me into writing the whole series. Since I have started working on the series, it was the main topic I wanted to describe. Initially, I planned to cover it as part of my Your SAP on Azure series that I’m running for the last couple of years. But as there are many intriguing concepts in OData-based extraction, and I wanted to show you as much as I can, I decided to run a separate set of posts. I hope you enjoyed it and learnt something new.
