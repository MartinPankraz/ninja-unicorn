Dear community,

As of yesterday, you may directly consume* SAP OData APIs via Azure API Management from any-premise no matter where they live from all Azure regionsðŸŽ‰: SAP Gateway, BTP ABAP environment, S/4HANA Cloud private or public edition in RISE or GROW, SuccessFactors, Ariba, Concur, Commerce Cloud, or SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) etc.ðŸ¤©

Azure API Management secures and simplifies the SAP API integration with popular Microsoft services like Power Platform, Azure Functions, Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) and Microsoft Sentinel to name a few.
