Dear community,

Today I am going to take you on a ride with me to enjoy a fully blown prototype to make real-time sales incentive adjustments with a low-code solution. Many routes lead to the city of Rome but for my implementation I chose to do it with the beloved SCP Business Rules service, the demo SAP S4 cloud system ES5 and Microsoft Teams. Exciting, isnâ€™t it? ðŸ˜‰
