Hello Community Members,

I’m back with some interesting PoV to demonstrate the SecOps & SAP Security elements on ‘SAP on Azure (or AWS, GCP, or on-prem systems)’, leveraging Cloud-based SIEM and SOAR solutions.

As we know SAP is the custodian for immense amounts of sensitive data in many of the most prominent organizations in the world. Since these applications are business-critical, and SAP security breach can be disastrous. However, protecting SAP applications is uniquely challenging always. We constantly require a prominent security squad and resources, characterizing with The Guardians of the galaxy to protect from any internal or external violations. SecOps on hyperscalers is a very comprehensive topic, so I will begin with a clear lodestar. In today’s post, I’d like to exhibit how the Azure services like Microsoft Sentinel, Logic Apps, SAP Connector can be configured altogether to protect all SAP users…An incredibly straightforward use case for advanced SAP users.
