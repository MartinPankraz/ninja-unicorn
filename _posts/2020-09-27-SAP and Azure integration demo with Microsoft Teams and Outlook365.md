The intention of this demo is to implement a basic scenario for integrating and displaying SAP ERP data in a Teams channel or an e-mail generated by Outlook. This can be conveniently achieved by consuming OData-services of the SAP Netweaver Gateway Server with a Logic App. To make this demo easily reproducible, the public SAP Gateway demo system E5 is used. For productive scenarios utilizing interfaces like IDoc, BAPI, or RFC the new Azure Logic Apps SAP Connector is recommended.

This document will describe the required step to enable the OData-based consumption of changed records in a SAP S/4HANA system.
