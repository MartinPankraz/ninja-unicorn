I always enjoy attending community events because that’s a good chance to learn something new. A few days ago I joined the first Azure Midlands Community meetup and when Microsoft MVP Marco De Sanctis presented how easy it is to manage TLS/SSL certificates in the Kubernetes cluster I thought I need to test with my SAP Data Hub installation and share it with you!
