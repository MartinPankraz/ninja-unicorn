SAP recently fixed a critical vulnerability in the SAP AI Core service that could have allowed attackers to access sensitive data in the multi-tenant environment. This issue, dubbed "SAPwned", was responsibly disclosed and publicly shared on July 18 after it was patched. You can read more about it [here](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/sap-ai-core-vulnerabilities-expose.html).

I use the [Microsoft Sentinel for SAP BTP solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/sap/sap-btp-solution-overview) - which went into General Availability state this week - as an example for running automatic detections via built-in analytic rules. Check out the alert “Failed access attempts across multiple Business Application Studio accounts” for instance. Password spray attack anyone?
