Origin and lineage are fundamental properties being used to balance trustworthiness, value, and quality for all sorts of things in life. In addition to that, it requires credible parties confirming those properties and traceability to prove a claimed lineage. The ancient monarchs didn’t want to get engaged with impostors resulting in damage to their reputation and heritage. The same is true for consumer goods, journalism, scientific publications – or data presented to you to gain insights and make decisions.
