What is CDN? Wikipedia describes CDN a “geographically distributed network of proxy servers, providing high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users”.

With CDN, the content is cached near the users around the world. With Azure CDN, at the time of writing, over 130 points of presence (POP) locations are available worldwide. This way content is delivered much faster since the network path is closer to users own or neighboring country instead of accessing from another continent.
