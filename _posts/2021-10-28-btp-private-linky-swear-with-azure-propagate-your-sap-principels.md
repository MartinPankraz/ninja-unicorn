Dear community,

Continuing with the implementation journey of BTP Private Link Service (PLS) we will have a closer look at the famous SAP Principal Propagation. The term describes the mapping of your BTP authenticated users to your SAP backend users to ensure audit trail and your complex server-side authorization mechanisms are applied. Your users on BTP or respectively CloudFoundry are identified by their email-address whereas SAP backend users usually have other ids.
