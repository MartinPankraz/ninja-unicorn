This hands-on lab facilitates Microsoft Teams as the preferred hub for teamwork and collaboration tool for todayâ€™s frontline and remote workers. Additionally Azure Bots, especially in the combination with Teams, are an impressive solution to efficiently guide internal employees and external clients through complex business processes spanning over multiple IT-backends like SAP and Office 365.
