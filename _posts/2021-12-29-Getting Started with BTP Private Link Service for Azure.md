Dear community,

I am running a series of blog posts around the topic of #SAP Private Link service with Azure. My primary goal is sharing service implementation experience and possible applications of this new BTP service, that is currently in SAP Beta. Ideally it gives you a kickstart into your own journey of private connectivity on BTP.
