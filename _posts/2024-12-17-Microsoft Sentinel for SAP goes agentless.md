Having a turn-key solution as much as possible leads to better adoption of SAP security. Agents running in Docker containers, Kubernetes, or other self-hosted solutions are not for everyone.

Microsoft Sentinel for SAPâ€™s latest capability re-uses the SAP Cloud Connector to profit from already existing setups, established integration processes, and well-understood SAP components. Bazinga!

The new integration path leverages SAP Integration Suite to connect Microsoft Sentinel with your SAP systems. The Cloud integration capability of SAP Integration Suite speaks all relevant protocols, has connectivity into all the places where your SAP systems might live, is strategic for most SAP customers, and is fully SAP RISE compatible by design.
