Dear community,

Last time we had a closer look at Stopping non-critical SAP systems as an integral part of any cloud practice to leverage resources efficiently in terms of capacity, cost, and self-service developer empowerment. Today I want to place the cherry on top (cake is probably eaten already) and put some more automation on the spot.
