Part II of the blog post series extends the Cloud-only scenario in part I with a hybrid identity setup that requires managing the user lifecycle across Microsoft Active Directory, Microsoft Entra, SAP BTP, SAP CIS, and an SAP system on-premise. Again, this blog post aims to provide technical guidance for migrating identity management processes from SAP Identity Management (IDM) to Microsoft Entra. Kudos to Marko Sommer (@MSo) for supporting the SAP cloud setup.
