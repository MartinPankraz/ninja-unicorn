The scope of this hands-on tutorial is a detailed description about the creation of a low-code canvas app for displaying tabular data from an SAP NetWeaver system.

To stay consistent with the recent demo-scenarios in this GitHub repository, the SAP Flight Model sample application was selected. This tutorial is built on top of the existing blog of Sameer Chabungbam and is intended to give a more detailed step-by-step description for new users of Microsoft Power Apps.
