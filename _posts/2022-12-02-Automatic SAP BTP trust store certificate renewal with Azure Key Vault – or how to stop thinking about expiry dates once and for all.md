Dear community,

Expiring TLS certificates create maintenance efforts all over the place and pose a security risk if not taken care of in time. Especially if the underlying private key was at risk. Furthermore, security guidelines advocate for shorter lifecycles. [GobalSign](https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/maximum-ssltls-certificate-validity-now-one-year), [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/support/resources/faq/public-trust-and-certificates/how-long-are-tls-ssl-certificate-validity-periods) and other official Certificate Authorities (CA) enforced a maximum of 13 months in 2020. However, most people want a lifetime of multiple years to avoid being bugged about it as seldom as possible.
