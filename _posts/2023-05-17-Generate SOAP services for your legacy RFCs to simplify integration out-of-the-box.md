Dear community,

supporting my post about ‚ÄúSecurity Orchestration, Automation, and Response‚Äù for SAP, I am sharing a step by step guide to expose your legacy RFCs as enterprise services (SOAP) through configuration. No development needed! However, an ABAP developer key is required to activate the enterprise service ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÉ

This way the RFC capabilities may be handled by API Management, workflow engines like SAP Build Process Automation, SAP Cloud Integration or Azure Logic Apps without special runtimes.

Such an approach is still useful, because some nice SAP remote function modules just don‚Äôt have a nice SOAP or OData interface today or maybe ever. S/4HANA Cloud anyone?
