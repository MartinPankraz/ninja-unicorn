Thanks for joining me for the third episode of the blog series on SAP CDC Connector and SLT. In the previous post, I covered the initial configuration steps required to set up the SLT engine to work with Azure. Today, I'll be taking a deeper dive into the extraction process and monitoring. These steps are essential to ensure a smooth and efficient replication of data from your SAP source system to your target system. By the end of this post, you'll have a better understanding of how to manage and troubleshoot the replication process.
