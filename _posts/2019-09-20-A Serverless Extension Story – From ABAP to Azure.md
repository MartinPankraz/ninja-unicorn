The topic of extensions especially side-by-side extensions is quite hot in the SAP ecosystem. The options available for such extensions are growing at SAP e.g. via the extension factory or ABAP Steampunk and so are your paths to make the intelligent enterprise reality. However, the cloud ecosystem is diverse, and you are not restricted to SAP’s offering for building extensions. I will not discuss extensions and how to build them from a “philosophical” perspective in this blog. Instead, I want to show you on a technical level what is possible with Microsoft Azure focusing on its serverless offering without any touchpoints to SAP except for the ABAP stack.
