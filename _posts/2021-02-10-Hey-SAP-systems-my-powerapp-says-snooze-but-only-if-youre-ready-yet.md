Dear community,

Stopping non-critical SAP systems is an integral part of any cloud practice to leverage resources efficiently in terms of capacity and cost. On top of that providing self-service on-demand start/stop capabilities to your developers empowers them. Solving this process through tickets or similar creates overhead that can be avoided.
