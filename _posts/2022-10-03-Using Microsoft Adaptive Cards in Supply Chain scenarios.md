We know that email or a pop up window could be used as a notification about an event. But if you are expecting a user reaction from that notification â€“ you might consider adding a button or a link that can trigger the expected action. We also know that lot of these actions could be meaningless if they lack details that lead to decision making. A notification email might be boring, or the notification window might be too small. An interesting overture to address this could be usage of contextual  notifications. Adaptive Cards from Microsoft not only offer the contextual awareness, but allow the user to trigger certain actions in a plethora of user interface components . Since adaptive cards are also an open source technology, it makes it even more interesting. In this blog, I like to share some scenarios where we used Adaptive Cards to existing business process in SAPs Digital Supply Chain.
