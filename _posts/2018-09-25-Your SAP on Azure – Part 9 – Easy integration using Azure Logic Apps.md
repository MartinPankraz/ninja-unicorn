Microsoft Azure is much more than just virtual machines. As soon as your account is created you get unlimited access to hundreds of features that you can easily use. I have already presented a few interesting scenarios where you can use a kubernets cluster to host multiple HANA databases or protect your landscape against unexpected events with integrated disaster recovery. Azure Logic Apps is another service that you can use to enhance and optimize SAP landscape. It allows you to build chains of actions and integrate SAP solution with external systems.
