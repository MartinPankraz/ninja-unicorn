Due to the fast-paced growth of APIs within organizations, inventory, governance, security, and management cannot keep up. The resulting fragmentation and inconsistency lead to adoption challenges, project delays, and security risks. Postman’s [State of APIs report 2023](https://www.postman.com/state-of-api/executing-on-apis/#frequency-of-api-security-incidents) shows that API security incidents happen frequently.

These challenges are summed up under the term “API Sprawl” by the industry.

Azure API Center embarked on the journey of taming the monster.
