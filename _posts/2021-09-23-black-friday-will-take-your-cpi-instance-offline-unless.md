Dear community,

Processing millions of messages with iFlows per day can already be a challenge. But getting hit by this order of magnitude within a short time frame (3..2..1..aaand 8.00am Black Friday discounts  are LIVE!!!) with a default CPI setup will likely be devastating â€“ even though there is no rubble or actual smoke involved â€“ Maybe just coming out of the ears of those poor admins fighting the masses to get the integration layer functional again ðŸ˜‰
