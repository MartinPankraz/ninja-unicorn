In this section you can find all required steps for your Extension Application to use SAP Private Link Service to consume OData resources from S/4HANA system located on Azure subscription. More details about SAP Private Link Service .

In our use case we are going to use the SAP Private Link service to communicate with an SAP S/4HANA system (or other SAP or non-SAP system running on a VM in your own Azure account) privately from within SAP BTP Cloud Foundry without SAP Cloud Connector.
