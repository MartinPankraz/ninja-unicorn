There are many Hadoop distributions available, like the HortonWorks or Cloudera. But you can also provision the cluster in the Cloud. Microsoft Azure offers service called HDInsights that can be used to quickly spin up a big data clusters without thinking about underlying infrastructure. It seamlessly integrates with Azure Data Lake Storage or Azure Storage Account creating a resilient and cost-effective solution. If you prefer PaaS services as I do, then you should definitely check it out.
