The goal of resilience or robust software design is to deal with failures that occur in complex system landscapes while they are being used, but should ideally go unnoticed by users. In contrast to conventional stability techniques, its objective is to maximize the availability of systems and system landscapes rather than to decrease the likelihood of failure occurring. It embraces the unavoidability and unpredictability of failures and concentrates on resolving them as soon as feasible.
