Dear community,

It is a given that SAP ERP is an interesting data-source for many users and applications. But you need to be sure, that data requests don’t interfere with critical ERP processes during periods of financial closing for instance and to manage all interested parties. Injecting an API Management solution in front of your SAP Gateway is a well-established approach to enable governance (who is calling what) and throttling to avoid overload.
