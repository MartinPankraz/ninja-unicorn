Dear Community,

In my previous [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/06/03/extend-your-business-processes-with-the-new-sap-private-link-service/), I introduced how to use the SAP Private Link service to extend your SAP S/4HANA business processes running on Microsoft Azure while keeping the traffic within the Azure internal network.

In this blog, I would like to share two more use cases for SAP Private Link connectivity:

- SAP Private Link service with SAP Cloud Integration for building diverse integration scenarios
- SAP Private Link service for frontend applications accessible from SAP Launchpad service
