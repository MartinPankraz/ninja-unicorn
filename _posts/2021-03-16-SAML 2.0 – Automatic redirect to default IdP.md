 SAP NetWeaver ABAP can be configured to use SAML 2.0 for Single Sign-on. You have to specify a default SAML 2.0 IdP to handle the user logons. After NW ABAP is configured, and the users are accessing a protected services like SAP WebGui, they are presented a screen asking you to select the SAML 2.0 IdP.
