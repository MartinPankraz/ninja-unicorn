Do you still remember how difficult it was to provision hardware when you had an upcoming project? I recall that it could take ages until the server was finally mounted to the rack and you could get on with the real work. It has changed over recent years, mainly because of the common availability of virtualization, but it is still not perfect (you need to buy the hardware eventually). What would you say if I could show you how to build the entire SAP NetWeaver production landscape within an hour? And I’m not talking about the easy, one server deployment.
