Recently I got my hands dirty with SAP Cloud Platform Enterprise Messaging.

Thanks to some fantastic blogs from Carlos Roggan  (get started with the first one [here](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/03/03/sap-cloud-application-programming-model-and-enterprise-messaging-1-intro) or [Dries Van Vaerenbergh](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/05/06/cloud-foundry-enterprise-messaging-webhooks-%F0%9F%93%A8/); also check out his YouTube [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKI2WgDS_k0) and also the super help from Tobias Griebe (Thanks!) it was quite easy to get started (you might also want to check out the tutorial [here](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-enterprisemessaging-learn-messaging-concepts.html).
