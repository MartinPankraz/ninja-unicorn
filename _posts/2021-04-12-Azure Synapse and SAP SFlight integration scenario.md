This document will describe an End to End(E2E) scenario demonstrating the integration between Azure Synapse and a SAP S/4HANA on Azure system.

To demonstrate the SAP integration with a well-known, less complex and repeatable data model, the SAP SFlight sample application was selected. Further information about the SAP SFlight sample application can be found here.

The motivation for creating this E2E scenario is to demonstrate, how SAP ERP data is practically processed using the Data-Warehouse(DWH) management components and services of Azure Synapse. This documentation is work in progress and the current plan is to continuously extend the scenarios and documentation.
