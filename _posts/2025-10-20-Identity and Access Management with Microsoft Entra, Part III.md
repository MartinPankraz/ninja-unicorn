Part II of this blog series took a technical deep-dive into a hybrid scenario for managing identities and their access across SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) and S/4HANA on-premise. Part III enhances the scenario by introducing SAP SuccessFactors (SF) as the source for employee and user data, and leverages the new capabilities in Entra for SCIM-based provisioning to SAP Cloud Identity Service (CIS) supporting groups to streamline end-to-end role assignments in the connected SAP ABAP backend.
