Dear community,

You can relax I won’t be talking about Arnie today ?but I will be “back” on the topic maybe next time. This post will be about closing the loop for SAP approval processes, that are surfaced in Outlook. So, we will not only see how to act upon the approval request from SAP but also see updates to the adaptive card in the E-Mail in case someone else already “approved”. Exciting, right? Probably, just short of the excitement, that there might be more movie references further down the line ?
