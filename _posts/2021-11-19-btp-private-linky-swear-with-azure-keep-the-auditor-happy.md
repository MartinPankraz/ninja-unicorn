Dear community,

Continuing with the implementation journey of BTP Private Link Service (PLS) we will have a closer look at limiting exposure of your http endpoints and RFCs. Your ERP is shipped with roughly 40k RFCs that can be remote enabled and a similar magnitude for http endpoints. Rumour has it you wonâ€™t be using all of them ðŸ˜‰
