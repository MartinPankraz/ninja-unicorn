SAP and Microsoft have announced their collaboration to modernize identity and access management (IAM) for SAP customers. SAP recommends its SAP Identity Management (IDM) customers transition to Microsoft Entra (formerly known as Microsoft Azure Active Directory) as the SAP IDM solution approaches the end of maintenance by 2027, with extended maintenance until 2030.
