Dear community,

Anyone out there still waiting for their next-gen console too? Due to supply-chain and sometimes even raw-material-availability challenges, many companies cannot drive sales as they would like to. To be fair, the Xbox is just one example of a product that is high in demand but short in supply. However, it makes a good headline ðŸ˜‰.
