How quickly are you able to rebuild your SAP landscape in case of data center failure? In case your disaster recovery plan is limited to performing daily backups, then just the process of provisioning new hardware (or VMs) can already take a long time – and you still need to move the data, install the software and finally restore the backup. On the other hand, having a cold standby site with ongoing database replication may be too expensive, especially for smaller organizations. But is it still a true? Does a secondary site have to be expensive?
