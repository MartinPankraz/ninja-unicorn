SAP is one of the most critical business systems deployed to the company landscape. It holds the most valuable data and many organizations fully relay on the availability of their SAP ERP or SAP S/4HANA solutions. Even a small disruption could cause big challenges and lead to disruptions in business operations. Therefore many organizations decide to implement the system running in a highly available mode, which means all components of SAP system: database, central services instance and application servers are redundant, so even a hardware failure doesn’t stop the system.
