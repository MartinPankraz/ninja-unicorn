It is crucial to maintain stringent security measures and respect existing SAP authorizations. By doing so, organizations can harness the benefits of low-code development while ensuring the protection and compliance of their SAP environment.

Oh boy, you ready for all the solutions, apps, curious interns, and mad scientists looking to interact with SAP ERP to combine with the Microsoft and Azure ecosystem? ðŸ˜®
Fear no more! SAP Principal Propagation using Microsoft Entra Id ensures your end users can re-use the same authorizations set for their named SAP backend user.
