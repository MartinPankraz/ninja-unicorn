Dear community,

Building on Frank’s [“BTP ABAP Environment on Azure” release announcement](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/06/06/sap-btp-abap-environment-on-microsoft-azure/) we will take you on a journey of various Microsoft integration scenarios with ABAP over the coming weeks. Excited yet?🤩 Using the language flavor “ABAP Cloud” ensures you’re set for the future no matter in which deployment style you are in today. Plain cloud or “embedded” living next to your ERP – you choose. Below integration scenarios are inter-changeable.
