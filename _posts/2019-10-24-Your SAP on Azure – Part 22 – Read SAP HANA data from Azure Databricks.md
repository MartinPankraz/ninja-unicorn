It has been a couple of weeks since I blogged last time, but I think I’m now on track with other projects and I’m happy to continue the SAP on Azure series! In the past few episodes, I focused on the integration of the SAP system with Azure data platform services. Today I will continue the topic and I would like to show you how to consume data stored in SAP HANA from the Azure Databricks. I know few people were interested in this topic so I’m happy I finally found time to write this short tutorial.
